This is my old [Lens Shop](https://github.com/Robert-Roszak/LensShop) project rewrittent in TypeScript.
Live demo is available [here](https://lens-shop-ts.vercel.app/)

The app features products featched from MongoDB (dynamic "Sale" icon upon changing DB parameters), validations on quantity, data inserted in checkout form, and order save on the DB.
In the backlog there are:
- posibility to log in/create account and review user's purchases,
- admin panel to manage states of orders,
- ~~email notification about each step of the order~~
